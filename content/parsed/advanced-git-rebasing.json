In contrast, rebase makes it appear as if we started the cleanup after all main changes. Merge provides a clear picture of parallel development, useful for understanding how different data processing features evolved simultaneously. Rebase creates a cleaner, linear history, making it easier to track the sequence of changes to our pipeline, but loses some contextual information.",

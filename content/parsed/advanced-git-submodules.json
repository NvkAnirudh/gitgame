      "content": "A Git submodule is a Git repository nested inside another repository. It allows us to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This is perfect for our projects when we want to include external libraries or shared components while maintaining separate version control. By using submodules, each submodule retains its own Git repository, allowing it to have its independent commit history and versioning. This means changes made within a submodule do not affect the main repository's history, and updates to the submodule can be tracked separately. This keeps the main project linked to a specific submodule version, independent of its development cycle.",

      "content": "When we want to pull the latest changes from a submodule's local or remote repository, we'll use the 'git submodule update' command with some specific options. There are several options. If we want to update a submodule with the source code stored locally, we use the following command using the `init` flag. For submodules with code stored on a remote repo, we use the `remote` flag. These two commands will update all submodules that fit this criteria. If we only want to update a specific submodule, we just need to provide the submodule path and any additional flags from above.",

Next, we extract the relevant files and history using `filter-repo` from the main project. Finally, we add the new repository as a submodule to our main project.",

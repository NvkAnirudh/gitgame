      "content": "Think of it as a separate checkout of our project with the same Git history but on a different branch. Git worktrees are linked, parallel workspaces in your repository, allowing us to work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing changes or duplicating files. We can easily switch between branches, work on a feature branch while fixing bugs on the main branch, and update the main branch without manual merges. It's especially helpful for projects with long-running tests, enabling uninterrupted development of other features.",

      "content": "To switch to another development item in a different branch, we can use either `git switch` or `git worktree`. Git switch only allows us to checkout one active branch at a time. So, if we use git switch, we would need to stash any incomplete changes, and switch to the new branch. Using git worktree, we can \"checkout\" the new branch into a separate directory, allowing us to work on it without disrupting or altering the development on the previous branch. No need for stashing changes! Worktrees give us isolated environments for each branch that avoids this. We can have multiple branches checked out and active at the same time, each in its own directory.",

      "content": "Git worktrees are particularly useful in various scenarios, such as working on multiple features simultaneously, handling urgent bug fixes without disrupting ongoing work, running tests on different branches in parallel, and conducting code reviews while continuing development. In our data pipeline project, we could use worktrees to develop new data sources while maintaining the existing pipeline in a separate directory. While Git worktrees offer significant advantages, they may not be suitable in scenarios where disk space is limited, as each worktree requires additional storage. They can also introduce complexity when dealing with very large repositories, making it challenging to manage multiple active branches. Additionally, for projects with frequent and complex merge operations, worktrees might complicate the process, potentially leading to merge conflicts.",

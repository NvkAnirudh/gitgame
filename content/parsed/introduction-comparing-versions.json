Then we can run git diff followed by the two commit hashes. Git will show what changed from the first commit to the second one. So, generally, we should put the most recent commit hash second. Alternatively, Git has a shortcut for us! The word HEAD, in capitals, can be used to refer to the most recent commit! To look at older commits we can reference them to HEAD by using a tilde, then a number. So, to compare the second most recent commit with the latest commit, we replace the first hash with HEAD-tilde-one and the second hash with HEAD. Tilde-one equates to the last commit minus one, so it represents one commit prior to the latest.",

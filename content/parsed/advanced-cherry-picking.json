      "content": "Git cherry-pick` is a command that copies a specific commit from one branch and applies it to another. Unlike merging or rebasing, which typically involve multiple commits, cherry-picking deals with individual commits. It's like saying, \"I want this specific change, but not everything else.\" When copying a commit from one branch to another, a new commit is created on the new branch with the same changes as the commit that was cherry-picked from the other branch. Cherry-picking multiple commits is also possible with the following command. The cherry-picking tool allows us to apply specific bug fixes or features to multiple branches without merging entire feature functionality. It is especially useful if we need to roll back a critical fix to a stable version. It is also useful if we want to experiment with new features and apply changes selectively. It also allows us to recover lost commits.",

      "content": "Sometimes, cherry-picking isn't smooth sailing. If the target branch has diverged significantly, we might encounter conflicts. When this happens, Git will stop the cherry-pick process and wait for conflicts to be resolved. To continue the process, we'll need to manually resolve these conflicts, stage the resolved files, and then continue the cherry-pick with `git cherry-pick --continue`. If things go south, we can always abort with `git cherry-pick --abort`.",

It's great for hotfixes or when we want to test a feature in isolation. However, be cautious: overuse can lead to duplicate commits and a confusing history. For larger sets of changes, merging or rebasing is often more appropriate.",

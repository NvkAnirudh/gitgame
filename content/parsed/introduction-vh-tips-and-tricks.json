We use the format of month, day, and year, where month is a three-letter abbreviation, day is one or two digits, and year is four digits. For example, to see commits since the second of April 2024 we execute git log dash-dash-since equals April two, 2024. We can add an end for the date range too. Here, we show commits between the second and eleventh of April 2024 by including the dash-dash-until flag at the end, followed by the date range to filter on.",

We can also provide a date using a numeric format, like 07-15-2024. While various date formats can be used, we recommend following ISO Format 6801, providing year, month, then day, separated by hyphens. We should also check our system settings to avoid unexpected results, such as 12-06-2024 being 6th December or 12th June! We can also provide month in written format, either abbreviated or in full, such as 15 July 2024. Note that we must not use other characters here, such as commas. 1 https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html",

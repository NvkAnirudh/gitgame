To do this, we use the git revert command, which reinstates previous versions of files and creates a new commit with these older versions. Note that it will restore all files updated in that commit. We need to provide a reference, through a commit hash or HEAD, to the changes that we want to undo. Referencing HEAD, means undoing changes made in the last commit, while adding tilde-one would undo, or revert, the second-most recent commit. Let's run this and see what happens.",

It worked for us in this scenario because we only committed a single file, but if we had updated more files, then those would have been reverted, too. To revert a single file, we need a different command. We use git checkout. It is a versatile command, which, in this scenario, allows us to check out one or more files from a specific commit, again using the commit hash or HEAD syntax. Here, we refer to the second most recent commit and narrow the command to a single file by including two dashes, a space, and the filename.",

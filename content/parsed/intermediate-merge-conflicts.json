A conflict is a scenario where Git is unable to resolve differences in contents of one or more files between branches. For example, if we edit the same file in two different branches, then try to merge, Git won't know which version should be kept. This results in a conflict. Let's see an example.",

However, one of our colleagues was not aware of this and thought that, given we are only adding a document rather than editing code, they could simply perform this same task in the main branch. So, we have two versions of the file in two branches - main and documentation! The version in documentation has an extra paragraph in the middle.",

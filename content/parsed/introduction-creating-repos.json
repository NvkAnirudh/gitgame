      "content": "To create a new Git repo for our project, we use the git init command in the terminal, followed by the name of our project, mental-health-workspace. When we run the git init command with the name we provided for the repo, Git creates a new repo within the directory we ran the command from. We can use cd to change into this new repo. We can check that the Git repo has been initialized correctly by running the git status command. Success! The output confirms we have a Git repo, and suggests that once we've created files we can use the git add command to track them using Git.",

Let's say we started working on the mental health in tech project without first creating a new Git repo.

We can see Git has immediately recognized that there are modified files not being tracked by Git, in this case, the report-dot-md file and files within the data subdirectory. The output encourages us to start tracking these files using Git! We'll discuss how to do this in the next video.",

Unless we are working on a very complex project, we should generally avoid creating a Git repo inside another Git repo, also known as nested repos. If we do this, there will be two dot-git directories. Unfortunately, as we try to make commits, Git will get confused about which directory it needs to update.",

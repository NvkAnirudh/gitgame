It can be useful for collaboration where cloud storage is prohibited, such as in enterprises with strict data privacy rules. We can make copies of a repo by using the git clone command followed by the path to the project repo. Here, we clone a local project from home/george/repo. We can also give the cloned repo a name by specifying it after the path, such as here, where we call it new_repo.",

If we have a GitHub account then we can access a remote stored on their server by cloning it on to our local computer. To do this we again use the git clone command, this time providing a URL rather than a local path. For example, here we clone a repo from github.com/datacamp/project.",

We do this using the git remote add command, and provide two pieces of information - the name that we would like to assign to the remote repo, and the URL, or the path to the directory. Here, we create a remote called george, which points to the url github.com/george_datacamp/repo.

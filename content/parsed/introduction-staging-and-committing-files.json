The staging area is created when we initialize a Git repository and it keeps track of what has been modified. Lastly, to save the files using Git, we make a commit. When we make a commit, Git will take a snapshot of the files at that point in time. This is essential in allowing us to compare files at different points in time and, if necessary, revert to previous versions!",

We include -m because it allows us to include a log message as part of the command. If we just wrote git commit it would open a text editor, which we would need to add a message to, save the file, then exit to return to the terminal. The output shows one file was changed and includes a series of characters called a hash. We'll learn about commit hashes in the next chapter. The log message is important, as we can refer to it later. The best practice is to keep it concise.",

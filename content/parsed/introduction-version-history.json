The commit contains metadata such as the author, log message, and commit time. The tree tracks the names and locations of files and directories when that commit happened. Think of it like a dictionary, with keys represented as unique identifiers, mapping to files or directories. For each file in the tree, there is a blob, which means binary large object. A blob may contain data of any kind. Blobs contain a compressed snapshot of the file's contents when the commit happened.",

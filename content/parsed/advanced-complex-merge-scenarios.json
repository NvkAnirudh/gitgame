Unlike the recursive strategy that produces a merge commit, this strategy adds a regular commit with only one parent. The squashed commit is added to the target branch and not the feature branch. So, we will lose the feature branch's commit history. The advantage of this method is that it reduce \"noise\" in our target branch. It gives us a clean, linear history.",

The reflog data is stored in the .git/logs/refs/heads/ directory. Reflog records every change to branch tips and HEAD positions, acting as a safety net for our Git operations. It provides us with the ability to recover from mistakes, such as mistakenly deleting branches, and to understand complex changes to our repository.",

Second, we can see the action taken. These actions may include commit, reset, or merge. It will not contain actions such as push, or fetch. Finally, the description is shown for each entry. 1 https://hackernoon.com/time-to-rewrite-your-git-history-effectively-with-git-reflog",

First, use `git reflog` to identify the commit hash at the tip of the deleted branch. Then, use `git checkout` with that hash to move HEAD to that commit. Finally, create another branch from that point using `git checkout -b`. This process effectively recovers our deleted branch and all its commits. 1 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3640764/can-i-recover-a-branch-after-its-deletion-in-git",

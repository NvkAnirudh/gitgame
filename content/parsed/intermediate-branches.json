Generally, this branch is where we store our working application, with everything functioning as expected, such as the DataCamp website. In a separate branch, we can develop and test a new feature, an AI assistant, to help learners find the content they need. During development, the new feature might not work correctly, but this won't affect the live system because it continues to run from the main branch!",

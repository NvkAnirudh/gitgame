Git merge is like combining two work streams. At its core, git merge combines changes from one branch into another. Git will take two branch pointers and attempt to find a common base commit between them. A merge strategy is a method Git uses to find a base commit and create a new base commit. `git merge` will select a merge strategy automatically unless a different strategy is specified.",

However, they don't preserve the lineage of a commit, which is crucial for tracing complex feature development on long-lived branches. If there's a conflict or if main has been updated since creating the feature branch, fast-forward merges won't work.",
